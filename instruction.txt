   ENCODING
   1. Enter 9 numbers from 0 to 15 (4 bits) in the field "Enter data to encode". After each entered number, press the space key.
   2. After entering 9 numbers, press the "Encode" button. If there are any issues, the program will notify the user.

   DECODING - SIMPLIFIED DECODER
   !!! ATTENTION !!!
   The full decoder is able to correct 3 arbitrary errors in the "data" polynomial. 
   The implemented simplified decoder is not able to correct all double and triple errors. 
   The effectiveness for double errors is 42.97% and for triple errors is 76.03%. 
   This depends on the location and values of the errors. 
   Sometimes, if too many errors are introduced, the data will be decoded as a completely different message.

   1. Enter 15 numbers from 0 to 15 (4 bits) in the field "Enter data to decode". After each entered number, press the space key.
   2. It is possible to copy the encoded data from the "Encoded data" field using the "Copy to decode" button.
   3. Errors can be introduced in the data to be decoded.
   4. After entering 15 numbers, press the "Decode" button. If there are any issues, the program will notify the user.
